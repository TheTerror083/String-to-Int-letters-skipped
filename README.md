# String to Int letters skipped
 this program receives a number as a command line argument and converts it  to an integer. <br>
 when a non-digit letter is encountered, the conversion stops and the result will be the numbers before the letter. <br>
 leading spaces will not cause a problem and are ignored. <br>
 however, when a space between numbers is encountered the conversion will stop.
